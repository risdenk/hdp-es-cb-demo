## Commiting Guidelines
Help us make the commit history pretty by following this commit style guide.

* Prefix your commit with a tag in brackets. Some useful tags:
    * [elasticapp] - for changes to the elasticsearch-twitter-webapp
    * [searchapp] - for changes to the searchapp
    * [stormapp] - for changes to the storm-search-app
    * [vagrant] - for changes to Vagrant artifacts
    * [docs] - for changes to .md files or other documentation
* Restrict line length to 80 characters or less. Here's how:
    * When commiting don't use the ```-m``` flag. Open the commit message in an editor and use multiline commits.
    * The first line of your commit should contain the prefix tag and a short description. Subsequent lines can contain a longer summary of the commit.
* Reference other issues and pull requests when applicable: ```Fixes #89```
* Do not push excessive numbers of commits. Squash commits together into concise blocks of changes.
